## 🛠️ Quick Start Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.9+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- MySQL 8.0 (or use Docker)

### Setup and Run

1. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

2. **Choose option 1 (Docker Compose)** for easiest setup
3. **Access the application**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8080/api
   - ML Service: http://localhost:5000
   - API Docs: http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui.html

### Test Credentials
Since no registration is implemented yet, you'll need to:
1. Start the backend
2. Use the login with any credentials (basic validation only)
3. Or implement the registration endpoint first

## 🔧 Development Tips

### Adding New Features
1. **Backend**: Create entity → repository → service → controller
2. **Frontend**: Define types → create API calls → build components
3. **ML**: Extend Python service for new AI features

### Database
- Tables are auto-created by JPA
- Sample data can be added via SQL scripts
- Use H2 for testing, MySQL for production

### Testing
- Backend: Spring Boot Test framework
- Frontend: Jest + React Testing Library
- ML: pytest for Python testing

### API Documentation
- Swagger UI available at `/swagger-ui.html`
- All endpoints documented with OpenAPI

## 🚀 Deployment Considerations

### Production Setup
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Configure reverse proxy (Nginx)
- Set up SSL certificates
- Use production database credentials
- Enable logging and monitoring

### Security
- Update JWT secret in production
- Enable HTTPS
- Configure CORS properly
- Implement rate limiting
- Add input validation

## 📈 Scalability Notes

### Backend Optimization
- Add caching (Redis)
- Database indexing
- API rate limiting
- Load balancing

### Frontend Performance
